Donut Game!!!
This game was originally going to be like that Waffle game.
The objective of the game was to eat enough to unlock the next island and continue to progress

Developers in this game:
Me (HeyItzMeJosie) - Scripter
My friend (aproxail) - Builder/UI man

The way I achieved this breaking effect on the donut was that I coded a little in the command bar and inserted WeldCOnstraints into every part in a specific order. 
If the parts around a part are broken then the parts just simply fall.
